# Runge-Kutta
The final project of K.N.Toosi University of Technology at Spring 2023.</br>
The Runge-Kutta method is a numerical technique used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form 
@@ dy/dx = f(x, y), y(0) = y0.
</br> The 4th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is a popular and commonly used method that gives approximate solutions to ODEs. It can only solve first order ODEs or higher order ODEs that are reduced to first order.
